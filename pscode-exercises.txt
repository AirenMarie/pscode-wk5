// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

num1 = 2
num2 = 6

sum = num1 + num2
print(sum) # 8

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num = int;

if num % 2 == 0:
  print("even");
else:
  print("odd");

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

b) average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers);
   print(average);

c) smallest = min(numbers);
   largest = max(numbers);

   print("The smallest number is: ", smallest);
   print("The largest number is: ", largest);

d) From (a): 6.0. This is the average determined by dividing the sum of the five numbers (20) by     the length of the array (5): sum(numbers) / len(numbers) = 20 / 5 = 6. 

From (b): "The smallest number: is 2.", "The largest number is: 10." This was found using min() and max(). This can also be found using numbers[0], which is the first number in the array, and numbers[4], which is the fifth number.
